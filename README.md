# AdventOfRust2021
Solving [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) problems in Rust! This is the third year I've participated in Advent of Code and I'd highly suggest trying to solve the puzzles on your own before viewing this repo!

## Running Exercises
To run a specific exercise, run `cargo run --example <ex_name>`.
For example, to run Day 1 Part 1: `cargo run --example day1`.

This year, I'll be combining parts 1 and 2 into the same file.

## Thank You!
I'd like to give a big thank you to Will Owens [@wsowens](https://github.com/wsowens) for getting me excited about learning Rust.
